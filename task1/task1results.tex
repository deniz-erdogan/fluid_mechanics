\subsection{Task 1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Grid Convergence %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Grid Convergence}
\noindent The geometry is modeled as an axisymmetric slice of the circular pipe using the Design Modeler tool of ANSYS Workbench. The same geometry is meshed into elements of different sizes to check whether the grid convergence is achieved or not. The element sizes tried to check convergence are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $10^{-2}$ meters
    \item $10^{-3} $ meters
    \item $5* 10^{-4}$  meters
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{images/task1/5e04mesh.png}
    \caption{Mesh of the geometry with $5*10^{-4}$ meters as element size}
    \label{fig:mesh_fig}
\end{figure}


\noindent It was determined that after $5*10^{-4}$ meters of size, the results have been converged. For this condition, node and element numbers can be seen from Table \ref{table:mesh_info}, the mesh consisted of 12721 nodes and 12000 elements. While Figure \ref{fig:mesh_fig} shows the mesh from a broader perspective, Figure \ref{fig:closer_look} shows a zoomed view of the mesh created. Also, the student version of ANSYS struggled highly with smaller mesh sizes anyways.

Number of elements & 12000                      \\
Number of nodes    & 12721   

\end{tabular}

    \caption{A closer view of the mesh.}
    \label{fig:closer_look}}
\end{figure}


\noindent In order to conclude that the results have been converged, velocity profiles of the fluid at different cross-sections have been compared until little to no improvement on the results have been observed on results. As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:convergence}, the results are almost the same between the element sizes of a and b. This relation is also closely observed on the velocity profiles from selected cross sections of the pipe.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Axial velocities along the centerline: a) Element size $10^{-3}$meters, b) Element size $5*10^{-4}$ meters.}
    \label{fig:convergence}}
\end{figure}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:convergence2} shows the similarity between two different mesh sizes that have been tried and checked for grid convergence. The velocity profiles are taken from x=1cm for both cases. While Figure-\ref{fig:convergence2}.a is smoother, the results are almost exactly the same for both cases.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering{
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{images/task1/convergence2.png}
    \caption{Comparison of the velocity profiles of element sizes at x=1cm shown on Figure \ref{fig:convergence}.}
    \label{fig:convergence2}}
\end{figure}


\noindent As requested from the project prompts, those 3 different mesh sizes are further compared by
plotting the axial velocity profiles at the axial locations of x = 0.5 cm, 1 cm,
1.5 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. Those plots can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:axials}. When compared, of course due to the difference in number of elements, finer mesh produces a smoother curve as expected since it contains more data points. However, the values kept at the same point are the same and the values are not changing with decreasing element size or increasing node count.

\end{figure}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Residuals and Calculations %%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Residuals and Calculations}
Once the calculation is run, we must be sure that a steady state condition is achieved. The reason for this check is due to nature of our solver and numerical methods used. Our solver stops the calculations on one of these two conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Residual error in each step have dropped under a set threshold determined by the user and the solution is converged.
    \item Maximum number of steps have achieved.
\end{itemize}

\noindent A plot of the residuals have been drawn and can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:residuals}. As can be seen, 
all of the tracked values have gone under $10^{-6}$ which is low enough to state that a steady state has been achieved at the step.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/task1/residuals.png}
    \caption{Plot of the Residuals for Task 1}
    \label{fig:residuals}
\end{figure}
\\
\\
\noindent Velocity profiles at several cross sections along the centerline can be seen on Figure \ref{fig:velprof3}. This plot can be validated by using the \textbf{Poiseuille-Hagen} solution by using the formula given below. 

\begin{equation}
    u = 2V_{avg} * (1- \frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}})
    \label{eq:hagen}
\end{equation}
\\
\\
\noindent Where $V_{avg}$ is the average velocity of the fluid inside the pipe, $R$ is the radius of the pipe 
and the $r$ is the radial distance of the point from the centerline.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{images/task1/vel_prof_3.png}
    \caption{Velocity Profile at x=3cm}
    \label{fig:velprof3}
\end{figure}

\noindent While not perfect, it can be clearly said that our simulation solution agrees with the given theoretical equations used to model these flows. When we plug in the values to equation \ref{eq:hagen}, we obtain the following solution:

\[ 2*0.554m/s * \Big(1 - \frac{0}{0.1^{2}m^{2}}\Big) = 1.108 m/s \] 

\noindent when evaluated at the centerline. This value is \textbf{within $1\%$} of the value we obtained from the simulation. A similar picture is seen when looked at the axial velocity profiles along the centerline of the pipe. A plot can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:axial}, the values are again in agreement with the theoretical values and become closer as the boundary layer is formed throughout the length of the pipe. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/task1/axial.png}
    \caption{Axial velocities along the centerline}
    \label{fig:axial}
\end{figure}

\noindent To further show the validation of the results, velocity profiles at $x=5$ and $x=7.5$cm have been plotted which can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:vel_profiles_hagen}. Also, using MATLAB, velocity profile at x=5cm have been plotted with the Hagen equation on the same plot to show how close the data are to each other on Figure \ref{fig:matlab_hagen}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Contours and Streamlines %%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Contours and Streamlines}
Another useful way of interpreting the results is by visualising the obtained data into different kinds of contours and using streamlines that represent the flow inside the pipe. Using the post-processing tools of ANSYS, I have plotted the pressure contour and streamlines both separately and on top of each other. Which can be seen on Figures \ref{fig:stream} and \ref{fig:stream_w_pressure}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/task1/streamlines.png}
    \caption{Streamlines for the flow}
    \label{fig:stream}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/task1/streamline_w_pressure.png}
    \caption{Streamlines for the flow plotted with pressure contours}
    \label{fig:stream_w_pressure}
\end{figure}

\noindent The streamlines for the recirculation zone can be clearly seen from the figures. This recirculation is induced by the expansion of the pipe. As the expansion causes a reduction on the pressure of the pressure at shown places, fluid particles at that point start to recirculate. \\

\noindent As expected, velocity is maximum in the centerline of the smaller pipe and pressure starts higher with the flow and dropping especially after the expansion. This drop in pressure is caused by the turbulent mixing of the flow where the pipe expands, which causes a decrease in mechanical energy.
